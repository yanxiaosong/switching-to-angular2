<h1>Hello {{name}}!</h1>
<p>
  Here's list of the things you need to do:
</p>
<ul>
  <!--template is a place where we can hold markup
  and make sure that it wont be rendered by the browser.
   This means that if the Angualr2 DOM Compiler doesnt process the DOM
   tree, all we are going to see are the h1, p elements-->
  <template ngFor let-todo [ngForOf]="todos">
    <!--note that the ngForOf attribute is surrounded by brackets. The semantics behind the brackets
    is that the value of the attribute surrounded by them is an expression, which needs to be evaluated. -->

    <li>{{todo}}</li>
  </template>
</ul>
